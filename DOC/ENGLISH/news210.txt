Version 2.10 alpha: the main differences from 1.51.10 beta 16.

[!] File panel setup options are completely new-made. Added new abilities.
[!] Drive menu and its setup is completely new-made.
[!] DBF viewer is borrowed from DN OSP with new abilities:
    - in field list (F2) a current field is selected, and one can move
      to any field of current record via field list;
    - hot keys Alt-Ctrl-Up, Alt-Ctrl-Down allow to move records;
    - codetable change now has effect on field names too.
[!] [Win32] Added very much preliminary version of net browser.
[!] Added very much preliminary DPMI32 version.
[!] Now mouse wheel is understood in a window under NT 5 and above,
    as well as under OS/2 with Amouse (with 2 or more "arrows").
    Under NT 4 and 9x/ME this should not work. Rotation of the wheel
    is treated in the editor, file panels, and help the same way as
    pressing of the scrollbar arrow. In all other cases the effect of
    the wheel's rotation is the same as that of using the cursor arrows
    (up or down).

[-] Appreciably changed country setup. Now DN is not limited to Russian
    language only. One can set corresponding tables, and DN will work
    correctly with any language (switch to upper/lower case, text search
    in OEM and Win- codetables, keyboard layout fix (Alt-F12)). It seems
    that the only place limited to Russian now is code page autodetection.
[!] Introduced new non-file panel - view of file descriptions.
    Hot key is Ctrl-D. Works with all file panels but archives.

[*] Now panel redraw on file selection removal in batch operations
    takes place on timer, which noticeably speeds up such operations.

[-] Fixed multiple bugs with search in different code pages.

[*] Now works D&D to path in panel header.

[*] In editor one can add Ctrl to Up, Dn, Shift-Up, Shift-Dn keys,
    to make text scroll with fixed cursor, instead of moving cursor
    with fixed text.
    Enabling ScrollLock mode now change this behaviour to the opposite:
    for example, Up scrolls text and Ctrl-Up moves cursor.

[*] Default codepage setting in dn.ini is separated for editor and viewer.
    DefCodePage key now has effect only on editor, and the separate key
    DefCodePageView is introduced for viewer.

[-] Removed unneeded delay before handling mouse events, which was
    noticeable under OS/2 (DN/2 window became stuck for some time
    after moving mouse cursor over it).

[-] It was impossible to use AltGrey in editor under Windows NT
    for entering national symbols.

[*] Changed drive menu and interface setup connected with it.

[*] Added new option for file search: "Don't sort result".

[*] (Win32) In Info panel and the bottom of file panel an information
    about HDD size and free space is always get from path in panel
    instead of drive letter (there may be difference on NTFS in case
    of softlinks.

[-] Descriptions are copied correctly from TEMP:, search and list panels.
[-] Multiline descriptions are copied correctly.
[-] When editing descriptions (Alt-Ins), only a first line is edited,
    other lines stay intact and don't get lost.

[*] Support for editing environment variables with more than 255 characters
    length.
[*] When trying to copy/move inaccessible files, the dialog
    "Retry/Skip/Skip all/Cancel" is shown.
[-] In file panels Alt-Ctrl-Enter, Alt-Ctrl-Ins, Alt-Ctrl-[, Alt-Ctrl-]
    combinations work similar to those without Alt, but give (under Win32)
    a name opposite to one in panel (for example, if panel shows LFN
    then Ctrl-Alt-Ins copies short name to clipboard).

[*] 7-Zip archives support.

[*] Command line key '/DNHIS=' or environment variable DNHIS sets
    suffix for history file name. This allows to have several different
    histories with common settings.

[*] Panel setup is completely new-made. Added new ways of formatting
    file names in panel and the bottom of panel.

[-] In OS/2 version the clipboard is cleared before copying to it.
    Absence of this operation caused that when copying something
    to clipboard in Mozilla, everything that DN copied after that
    was ignored by Mozilla.
[-] (Win32) Fixed copying full file name to clipboard (ak50514a.dif caused
    that long file name was copied with short path, and vice versa).
[-] (Win32) Added ability to copy alternate full file name to clipboard
    with Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Ins.
[-] In editor when searching for one symbol backwards with option "Whole words"
    turned on, and there is sought character which is not a separate word,
    search could get caught in an endless loop.
[-] In editor when searching for a pattern consisting of similar separator
    characters (for example, '***'), and it appears in text among
    the same characters (for example, '*****'), this pattern could be found
    later than needed (or not found at all).
[+] Added ability to insert an empty record in current dBase record
    with Ctrl+I.
[+] Added ability to move a line up or down in dBase file with hot keys
    Alt+Ctrl+Up ¨ Alt+Ctrl+Down.
[*] Improved SFX detection.
[-] (Win32) DN crashed when turning off and on automatic refresh of panels.
[-] (Win32) "Name" column width could not be changed with mouse.
[-] It was impossible to enter 7z archives with Ctrl-PgDn. Some other
    demonstrations of this error also could happen.
[*] When opening a non-file panel (for example, with Ctrl-Q) in maximized
    file panel, this command is not ignored now. It turns off maximization
    and then works as usual.
[*] When turning on quick search the mask appears immediately, not after
    entering first symbol as earlier.
[-] In quick search mode the second press of quick search hot key
    (for example, pressing and releasing Alt), did not turn off quick
    search.
[-] Sometimes (in a random way) when dn.cfg was missing, the About panel
    was not shown.
[-] Quick search cursor could spontaneously jump anywhere when automatic
    refresh of panels was turned on.
[-] Drive line never got renewed with automatic refresh of panels
    turned off.
[*] Ineffective insertion sort when reading directory was replaced
    by regular sort of file collection.
[*] Considerable rework of information panel.
[-] When copying files, the cluster size of destination drive
    was calculated incorrectly.
[*] Select preset menu can be accessed not only with Alt-"-", but also
    via main menu item "Panel => Select appearance preset..."
[*] In select preset menu (Alt-"-") "Description" flag is shown
    only for those types of panel where it is really used.
[*] If full directory name does not fit in width of directory history
    dialog, the path is cut so that directory name can be seen.
[-] In dialogs of editor and viewer history the last character
    in file name could not be seen.
[*] The width of command history, directory history, viewer and editor
    history dialogs was extended to 78 symbols.
[*] In history dialogs of commands, directories, viewer and editor it is
    now possible to use Ctrl-Left/Right to switch between the ordinary mode
    of cutting file names and the mode in which only the left part of path
    is cut.
[*] Added ability to open branch of a directory or an achive including
    not only files but directories as well (hot key Alt-Ctrl-H).
[*] Now DN/2 will show time and speed when copying files.
[*] Panel setup options in menu moved from main "Panel" submenu to
    "Options" submenu.
[-] DN crashed after setting video mode in which number of lines multiplied
    by number of columns exceeded 8192.
[*] Eliminated file manager setup option "Separator", because now any
    information can be shown on separator, so there is no reason to turn
    it off.
[-] In HEX mode in lines shorter than 16 bytes symbols with codes < 0x20
    were highlighted incorrectly.
[-] In editor when trying to make a selection right after search,
    the first position of selection was the beginning of line instead of
    cursor position.
[-] Fixed cursor positioning in HEX mode.
[*] Start with only one non-English package is possible.
[-] Correct loading of resources in case of errors in country setup.
[-] DN/W32 did not show disk information if disk label consisted of
    11 symbols.
[-] Tildes in file description were incorrectly shown in the bottom of panel.
[-] After disabling showing on separator and enabling showing in the bottom
    of file panel, D&D from the corresponding place still worked like if
    information remained there.
[*] Introduced setup of alphabet sorting in country setup. In Win32 version
    only the option of using xlt-file works now.
[*] Added file XLT\sort866.xlt which assigns the alphabet sorting for
    code page 866. This file is based on system table of sorting for
    eComStation.
[-] Masks '*' and '.' in dn.edt did not work.
[-] When copying files the free space on destination drive was not
    controlled regardless of the corresponding option.
[*] Optimized work with buffered streams. This may speed up viewing (F3)
    files from network, and probably other file operations.
[*] Detection of CAB-SFX kind of Microsoft product hotfix.
[-] DN crashed after selecting a single-line stream block, which does not
    contain correct expression, and pressing Alt-Ins.
[-] If a non-file panel was active in file manager, then something strange
    was inserted in command line with Ctrl-Enter. Now the current directory
    in tree is inserted from tree panel, and nothing is inserted from
    Viewer, Info and Description panels.
[-] On presence of a non-file panel, information in window list (Alt-0)
    reflected the previous file panel which was on the same place before
    calling this non-file panel.
[-] (Win32) In file panels hot keys Ctrl-[ and Ctrl-] with and without Alt
    worked in opposition to what is needed (without Alt they should copy
    file name visible in panel to command line, and with Alt they should
    copy alternate file name).
[-] Hot keys Ctrl-Shift-[ and Ctrl-Shift-] did not work in file panels
    under Windows NT.
[-] In file panels hot keys Ctrl-Shift-Up, Ctrl-Shift-Down worked very
    strange: cursor was not moved, but after releasint Ctrl file was opened
    fore viewing. Now these combinations do nothing.
[-] After turning off D&D with mouse from panels, it still worked from
    the bottom of file panel.
[*] Added ability to turn off quick search completely.

[*] Obscure and incorrectly working modes of inserting paths were eliminated
    from dialog of making file list. Instead of them buttons for inserting
    file name and path were added.

[*] Optimized detection of archives.
[-] Fixed errors in "Split/combine" function.

[*] Now using the mouse on the scrollbar arrows in the editor, file panels,
    and help moves the text up or down while the text cursor stays fixed
    relative to the window.
[*] DosShell, PCTools, and Blue  palettes are removed from the distribution
    and not supported anymore. If someone really needs them, please write
    about that to akorop[at]online.kharkiv.net, they can be restored.
[*] Calendar has been incorporated from the DOS version of DN OSP, with
    the following differences:
    - reminder eliminated;
    - day highlighting is done by color, not brackets;
    - added highlighting of the current date;
    - Ctrl-Ins copies selected date into the buffer;
    - if calendar is called from the editor, Enter inserts the date
      selected into the text being edited;
    - in the dialog with color settings, the color names were adjusted.
    ATTENTION! For the new calendar to be functioning correctly, the
    new palettes should be used. They are supplied together with dn.exe,
    but the palettes must be loaded manually.
[*] Now the action of the RIGHT mouse button on square brackets in the
    drive line is the wide opening of the respective panels (']' for the
    right panel, '[' for the left panel).
[*] If a file panel has already been widely opened, then the mouse actions
    in the drive line are related to that panel, i.e. it becomes hidden
    by using the left mouse button or shrinks to its standard size by
    using the right mouse button.
[*] Now clicking the mouse outside of all panels and command line is
    equivalent to Ctrl-O.
[-] Treatment of Ctrl-Enter in the editor was restored.
[*] The loading files for edit is optimised.
