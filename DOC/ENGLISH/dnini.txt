                              automatically. Zero value will cause opening of
                              new window always.

 [Language]

 ShowLanguageMenu = bool    - The value 1 means, that choosing the
                              "Change language" command in menu or pressing
                              Alt-F12 will show the menu containing list of
                              all languages available (the set of available
                              languages is defined by searching of resource
                              files in DN and %DNDLG% directories). This is
                              convenient when there is more then two
                              languages installed in program. Te value 0
                              (default) means that the "Change language"
                              command or Alt-F12 pressing will automatically
                              switch to next language available after current.
                              (default: 0)

 HelpLanguageOverride = str - When non-empty value is set, then it will be
                              concerned to be the name of the help system
                              language. For example, when
                              "HelpLanguageOverride=english" is set, then
                              the help file "english.hlp" will be used.
                              When value is empty or key is absent, then
                              help file for current (active) language will be
                              used. If help file for active language is
                              absent, then help file for English language
                              will be used.
                              (default: )

 ActiveLanguage = str       - When non-empty value is set, then it will be
                              used as a current language name. For example,
                              when "ActiveLanguage=russian" is set, then
                              resource files "russian.*" will be used.
                              When value is empty or key is absent, then
                              the "DNLNG" environment variable will be used.
                              If this environment variable is absent as well,
                              then English language will be used.
